I am a Freelance Fullstack developer with a passion for building digital services/things. I find planing, designing and the implementing logic to solve problems with code absolutely fun. I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base, however I am interested in ambitious or large team based projects.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
         My coding journey began back in 2019 when I found out a couple friends of mine were into to programming. A little bit of research later and I found out that Python was the easiest programming language to learn for beginners. I played around with it for a while but didn't get very far. I was trapped in tutorial hell as I have come to discover. But what I realized was, I was only learning programming because my friends did it. I had no goal. I was doing doing it just because. 
Fast forward to late 2021, I bought myself a proper laptop and decided to try my hand at programming again. This time I did better research and settled on Web Development. I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, Html & CSS. Wasn't very smooth at first, tutorial hell came back around for a while but sticking to the fundamentals and working on projects ever scaling up in complexity, made me garnered the skills to tackle a Frontend Framework, React JS. My current tool. 
React JS has been fun to work with, I learn something new every time I load up a new project. I feel like an actual Web Developer on the verge of making a break through in getting into a company and putting my skills to use. 
With React JS I have learnt some other tools for development: MongoDB, Express JS, Node, Firebase and recently ChatGPT which has been a mighty fine tool I can pull up when I am stuck on something.
